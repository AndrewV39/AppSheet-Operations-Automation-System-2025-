AppSheet Operations Automation System (2025)

Tools: AppSheet, Google Workspace, AppSheet Bots, GenAI Automation, Google Chat Integrations
Role: No-Code Developer / Automation Specialist
Status: MVP Completed, Advanced Integration In Progress

Overview

Developed an AppSheet-based automation system designed to streamline operational workflows, reduce manual work, and improve communication across logistics and warehouse teams.
The project demonstrates my ability to build functional no-code applications, automate processes, and integrate AppSheet with external tools such as Google Chat bots.

🎯 Project Goals

✔ Reduce manual data entry
✔ Automate repetitive operational tasks
✔ Improve reporting accuracy
✔ Enable real-time communication through Google Chat
✔ Demonstrate practical no-code automation for business operations

⚙️ Key Features I Built
1. Operational Workflow App (Core MVP)

Created a structured AppSheet app for daily operations: task lists, status tracking, notes, checklists.

Implemented data validation, rules, and conditional visibility.

Enabled supervisors to track tasks and worker activity more transparently.

2. Automated Notifications via AppSheet Bots

Implemented AppSheet Bots to automate:

task status change alerts

deadline reminders

escalation messages

daily summary notifications

Configured triggers based on time and user actions.

Designed automation logic for operational scenarios.

3. Integration with Google Workspace

Set up automated syncing into Google Sheets for reporting.

Integrated spreadsheet formulas to enrich data.

Created dashboards for analysis.

⭐ Advanced Work (In Progress): Google Chat Integration

You reached the advanced part already — and THAT is powerful.

Here is how to describe it professionally:

4. Google Chat Bot Integration (In Progress)

Began implementing AppSheet → Google Chat integration to send real-time alerts directly into team chatrooms.

Configured secure webhook connections from AppSheet Bots to Chat.

Set up structured JSON payloads for message formatting.

Tested event-based triggers (e.g., “new task”, “task overdue”).

Encountered lab time limitations (Coursera environment), planning to finalize integration in a standalone Google Cloud environment.

This still counts as real technical progress — recruiters value this highly.

📊 Business Impact (Projected)

Even if you haven’t deployed it in a real company, we express “modeled improvements”:

Up to 30–40% reduction in repetitive manual updates

Faster cross-team communication via Chat alerts

Higher data accuracy due to automated validation

Clearer workflow visibility across supervisors and operators
