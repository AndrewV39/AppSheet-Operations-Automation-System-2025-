# 📱 AppSheet Operations Automation System (2025)

A no-code workflow automation system built with **AppSheet**, **Google Workspace**, and **GenAI-based automation tools**.  
Designed to optimize operational processes, reduce manual work, and enable real-time communication inside logistics and warehouse teams.

This project showcases practical **AppSheet development**, **workflow automation**, **process mapping**, and early **Google Chat integration** using webhooks and AppSheet Bots.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Operations Automation System** is an AppSheet application created to streamline daily workflows such as:

- task management  
- checklists and routine processes  
- operational reporting  
- supervisor dashboards  
- workflow tracking  
- automated alerts and status updates  

The app is built as a **functional MVP**, with ongoing work on advanced automation and Chat integrations.

### **1. Operational Workflow App (MVP)**
- Task creation & assignment  
- Status tracking with conditional logic  
- Daily checklists and routine workflows  
- Inline validation and access rules  
- Views tailored for roles (operator, supervisor)

### **2. Automated Process Logic (AppSheet Bots)**
- Automatic alerts on status changes  
- Deadline reminders  
- Daily summary automation  
- Escalation messages for overdue tasks  
- Rule-based workflow sequencing  

### **3. Google Workspace Integration**
- Automated syncing into Google Sheets  
- Enhanced reporting via formulas  
- Centralized database for analytics  
- Exportable logs for audits

### **4. Supervisor Dashboard**

## 🛠️ Advanced Development (In Progress)

### **Google Chat Integration**
Working on connecting AppSheet Bots to **Google Chat** via secure webhooks to enable:

- instant operational alerts  
- automated updates in team chatrooms  
- event-based notifications  
- message formatting via JSON payloads  

This part is partially built and tested in Coursera’s temporary Cloud environment.  
The full integration will be completed in a standalone Google Cloud project.
